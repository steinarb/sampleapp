* Sampleapp

This is a barebones sample application for a multi-module, multi-bundle apache karaf web application.

Intended to make it simple to start a new webapp.

The application database has a single table "accounts" listing the users that are allowed to log into the database.

The application OSGi service Java interface (SampleappService), has a single method "getAccounts()", which is taken through a jersey JAX-RS REST resource (AccountsResource) and the result is displayed in a react frontend (so a narrow path all the way from an SQL database and to a react frontend).

The rest of the user information (full name, email) comes from an injected OSGi service of type [[https://www.javadoc.io/doc/no.priv.bang.osgiservice/osgiservice/latest/no/priv/bang/osgiservice/users/UserManagementService.html][UserManagementService]] provided by the [[https://github.com/steinarb/authservice][authservice]].

The username/password combinations of users in the test db version of authservice, are:
| username | password  | authorized for sampleapp |
|----------+-----------+--------------------------|
| jad      | 1ad       | yes                      |
| jod      | johnnyBoi | no                       |

** Development status
[[https://travis-ci.org/steinarb/sampleapp][file:https://travis-ci.org/steinarb/sampleapp.svg?branch=master]]

** Installing the sample application

Give the following commands to the karaf console:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  feature:repo-add mvn:no.priv.bang.sampleapp/karaf/LATEST/xml/features
  feature:install sampleapp-with-derby
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Creating a new application based on the sample app

Using the [[https://maven.apache.org/archetype/maven-archetype-plugin/i][maven archetype plugin]] to adapt the sample project to a new project is simpler than hand editing the sample project and moving all packages and module names, but it doesn't take you all the way (it doesn't rename Java classes and doesn't fix up the shiro.ini files).

To create a new project called "mynewapp":
 1. First clone the sample project and create an archetype from it (it's best to create an archetype from a fresh clone, because then the archetype won't contain unnecessary files like IDE config files and binary files from the build)
    #+begin_example
      cd /tmp
      git clone https://github.com/steinarb/sampleapp.git
      cd sampleapp
      mvn archetype:create-from-project -Darchetype.filteredExtensions=java
      cd target/generated-sources/archetype/
      mvn install
    #+end_example
 2. Create the new project from the archetype (the -DgroupId, -DartifactId, and -Dversion arguments are the GAV values of the new project)
    #+begin_example
      mkdir -p ~/git/
      cd ~/git/
      mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=local -DarchetypeGroupId=no.priv.bang.sampleapp -DarchetypeArtifactId=sampleapp-archetype -DgroupId=no.priv.bang.mynewapp -DartifactId=mynewapp -Dversion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT -DinteractiveMode=false
    #+end_example
 3. Fix up some files that aren't handled by the archetype filtering (don't know why everything in the pom files aren't filtered)
    #+begin_example
      cd ~/git/mynewapp/
      sed -i 's/sampleapp/mynewapp/g' */src/main/resources/shiro.ini
      sed -i 's/sampleapp/mynewapp/g' */src/test/resources/test.shiro.ini
      sed -i 's/sampleapp/mynewapp/gI' */pom.xml
      find . -name \*.js | xargs sed -i 's/sampleapp/mynewapp/g'
    #+end_example
 4. Test build the project with "mvn install" (it should build without any errors)
    #+begin_example
      cd ~/git/mynewapp/
      mvn install
    #+end_example
 5. Open the java maven modules of the mynewapp project, in a Java IDE (eclipse or IntelliJ), and use the refactoring of the IDE to rename classes with names starting with "Sampleapp" into classes starting with "Mynewapp" (this is the step that the archetype can't handle, but at least the classes are already in packages they are supposed to be in for the new application)
 6. Build mynewapp from the top with "mvn clean install" ("clean" is to get rid of .class files with the old names)
    #+begin_example
      cd ~/git/mynewapp/
      mvn clean install
    #+end_example
 7. Install mynewapp in a karaf instance
    #+begin_example
      feature:repo-add mvn:no.priv.bang.mynewapp/karaf/LATEST/xml/features
      feature:install mynewapp-with-derby
    #+end_example
 8. Verify that the application is running on http://localhost:8181/mynewapp

** Configuring a new default locale

Out of the box, the sample application supports two locales: nb_NO (Norwegian bokm√•l) and en_GB (UK English).

The locale texts are provided by a Java resource bundle, and new languages can be added by adding them to the bundle and to the available locales returned by the SampleappService.

The default locale is nb_NO.

It is possible to persistently configuring the default locale to en_GB with the following commands in the karaf console command line:
#+begin_example
  config:edit no.priv.bang.sampleapp.backend.SampleappServiceProvider
  config:property-set defaultlocale en_GB
  config:update
#+end_example

/Note/! The name of the config file will change when the package name and classname of the class changes in a new application based on this one, so adjust the command example accordingly.
